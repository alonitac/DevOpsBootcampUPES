# CI/CD with Jenkins

## Install Jenkins Server on EC2

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process with the built-in Java servlet container/application.

1. Create a ***.medium, Ubuntu** EC2 instance with `20GB` disk.
2. Connect to your instance, install java by

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre
```

3. Download and install Jenkins as described [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu).
4. On Jenkins machine, [install Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). You may want to add jenkins linux user the docker group, so Jenkins could run docker commands:
   ```shell
   sudo usermod -a -G docker jenkins
   sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
   ```
5. Install `kubectl`. 
6. Install Git if you don't have.
6. You'll need your Jenkins server to have static public ip address. From the EC2 navigation pane, create an **Elastic IP** and associate it to your Jenkins instance.
7. Open port `8080` and visit your Jenkins server via `http://<static-ip>:8080` and complete the setup steps.
8. In the **Dashboard** page, choose **Manage Jenkins**, then **Manage Plugins**. In the **Available** tab, search and install **Blue Ocean** and **Docker Pipeline** plugins. Then restart jenkins by `http://<ip>:8080/safeRestart`

## Configure a GitHub webhook

A **GitHub webhook** is a mechanism that allows GitHub to notify a Jenkins server when changes occur in the repo. 
When a webhook is configured, GitHub will send a HTTP POST request to a specified URL whenever a specified event, such as a push to the repository, occurs.

1. Use your docker project GitHub repo, or create a new GitHub repository for which you want to integrate Jenkins.
2. To set up a webhook from GitHub to the Jenkins server, on your GitHub repository page, go to **Settings**. From there, click **Webhooks**, then **Add webhook**.
3. In the **Payload URL** field, type `http://<jenkins-ip>:8080/github-webhook/`. In the **Content type** select: `application/json` and leave the **Secret** field empty.
4. Choose the following events to be sent in the webhook:
    1. Pushes
    2. Pull requests
